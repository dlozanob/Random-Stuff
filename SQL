// Fields are the titles of the columns, rows are called records
// A table is an arrangement of related data
// A database contains one or more tables
// Each SQL command-line contains a ';' at the end

// Main statements:

SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index


SELECT <field> FROM <table>; // The select command shows an specified column from a table, Use '*' for all.
SELECT <field1>, <field2> FROM <table>; // Selecting multiple fields at once.

// Fields and statements are not case-sensitive.

SELECT DISTINCT <field> FROM <table>; // The 'DISTINCT' statement removes duplicated values.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <field>) FROM <table>; // Returns the number of records that are different each other.

// The 'WHERE' clause is used for requirements specifying a condition.

SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico'; // Selects all the records whose country is Mexico.
// The example is in the form: SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <field>='<value>'
// Numeric values are not enclosed in quotes.

// Operators used in the WHERE clause:
=	            Equal	
>	            Greater than	
<	            Less than	
>=	          Greater than or equal	
<=	          Less than or equal	
<>	          Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	      Between a certain range	
LIKE	        Search for a pattern	
IN	          To specify multiple possible values for a column

// We can use the 'NOT', 'AND', 'OR' operators to set a conditional

SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München'); // Will display customers whose country is Germany and whose city is Berlin or München.
